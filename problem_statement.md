## 1. Problem Statement

Build an in-process Background Job Service. Producers submit jobs; workers pull jobs and execute them. The service guarantees at-least-once execution, retries failed jobs with backoff, surfaces stuck jobs, and exposes observability into queue health.

Think of it as a minimal Sidekiq / Celery / SQS-with-workers, all in one process for the purpose of this exercise.

### 1.1. Core Functional Requirements

1. Submit a job - `submit(job_spec) -> job_id`. The spec contains:
    - `type` (string) - which kind of work this is (e.g., `"send_email"`, `"resize_image"`)
    - `payload` (object) - opaque data passed to the handler
    - `priority` (int 0-9, higher executes earlier; default 5)
    - `max_retries` (int, default 3)
2. Worker model - workers register with a list of `types` they can handle. They pull jobs by acquiring a lease (visibility timeout). While a job is leased, no other worker can pick it up. Workers must renew the lease for long-running jobs; if the lease expires without renewal (worker crash, network partition, slow handler), the job becomes available to another worker.
3. Job lifecycle - implement the state machine:
   ```
   pending -> claimed -> succeeded
                      -> failed (retries exhausted, moved to DLQ)
                      -> retry_scheduled -> pending (after backoff)
   ```

   Lease expiry on `claimed` jobs returns them to `pending`.
4. Retry policy - failed jobs are re-queued with exponential backoff (you choose the formula, defend it). After `max_retries` exhausted, the job moves to a Dead Letter Queue (DLQ).
5. Job execution - the candidate provides a `JobHandler` interface. Workers invoke `handler.run(payload) -> Result` where `Result` is `Success | TransientFailure | PermanentFailure`. `PermanentFailure` skips retries and goes straight to DLQ.
6. Observability API - methods to query:
    - Pending count by type and by priority
    - Currently leased (in-flight) count
    - DLQ size, with ability to list DLQ entries
    - Per-worker stats: current lease, success/failure counts
7. Tests - cover at-least-once on worker crash (lease expiry), retry behavior with backoff, lease renewal happy path, priority ordering, DLQ on max retries, permanent-failure short-circuit.

### 1.2. Required Behaviors You Must Resolve in Your Plan

These are deliberately ambiguous. Decide and justify in `PLAN.md`:

- Lease duration - fixed across all jobs? Per job type? Settable on submission? What's the default and why?
- Lease semantics on overrun - if a worker takes longer than the lease and the job has been re-leased to worker B, what happens when worker A finishes? Does it commit `succeeded`? Get rejected?
- Priority semantics - strict (priority 9 always before priority 8) or weighted (high priority gets more bandwidth but low priority isn't starved)? What guarantee, if any, do you make?
- Same-priority ordering - FIFO, LIFO, or unspecified?
- At-least-once vs at-most-once - at-least-once is required by the spec; what guidance does your service give to handlers about idempotency?

### 1.3. Out of Scope

- Network transport. Workers run as goroutines / threads / async tasks in the same process as the service. The interfaces should be designed so a network layer could be added later, but don't implement it.
- Persistent storage. In-memory data structures are fine; the design should be clear about where the persistence boundary would live.
- Cron-style recurring jobs.
- Job dependencies / DAGs.

## 2. Process Requirements

The Agentic Coding Round process rules apply (see prep doc). Specifically for this question:

- Write `PLAN.md` first. Walk the interviewer through it before invoking your agent for implementation.
- Commit incrementally. The git log is part of the deliverable.
- Tests are the unit of progress. No "done" without green tests, and the tests must actually exercise concurrency where the spec calls for it.
- The interviewer will introduce an extension around minute 70. Plan your time accordingly.
